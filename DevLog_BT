I) === Summary: ===
	A) Struggling to get push Notifications when new posts are made
	B) Hypothesized possible Push Notification issues
	C) Changed Status bar color to same as Toolbar

II) === Takeaways: ===

III) === Resources: ===

IV) === Log: ===

A) Continued trying to subscribe to Push Notification Plugin API
	1) Firebase sends the notifications fine
	2) Added FirebaseDeviceRegistration as a Service
		- now it is in the right place but still isn't registering with the plugin
	3) Found a different Server Key on Firebase to use with the plugin
		- "Legacy Server Key": AIzaSyBA0x9f7aOUKcK7dn16h39uo1F6HYkU9vM
			- also referred to as Web API Key
		- "Server Key": AAAA1x34GAk:APA91bGfJAirRlRPTQpjimUCNeOyeU4tKqb3wTgszLzkwBTQelspiZ_2KksOPN4p1apim5qLqfRUfWByEQJSrfPE10oZGAVQGU1oCkTjNXJ8iIqZL1OB4nXCGP3u013WeMWPgvzbYtKE
	4) Switched back and forth between using the "Notification Message" and the "Data Message"
		- Notification Message = Firebase Cloud Messaging automatically displays the message to end-user devices on behalf of the client app
			- This would be ideal and should be automatic
		- Data Message = Client app is responsible for processing data messages
			- We should be set up to handle this
		- From the plugin's FAQ: "When I send a notification from Firebase console everything works properly, while when I send them from the plugin nothing is received. What should I do?"
			- "With the Notification message Firebase automatically displays the message to end-user devices on behalf of the client app. With the Data message client app is responsible for processing data messages."
			- "You can enable Notification messages in the Settings → Android → Firebase enabling Use the Notification message instead of the Data message"
			- https://www.delitestudio.com/wordpress/push-notifications-for-wordpress/faqs/
		- It definitely looks like "Notification Message" should work automatically without a handler

B) Possible Push Notification issues
	1) App must be registered with the plugin
		a) since we are using FCM and a Server key we shouldn't need to do this (See part 2)
		b) The "Configuring Android Push Notifications" tutorial from Delite Studio does not mention anything about registering
			- https://www.delitestudio.com/wordpress/push-notifications-for-wordpress/configuring-android-push-notifications/
		c) The "Documentation" from Delite Studios says to connect the App using the Register API
			- https://www.delitestudio.com/wordpress/push-notifications-for-wordpress/documentation/
			- could this be specifically for the paid version?
		d) The FirebaseDeviceRegistration service I wrote sends the POST request to the API but it doesn't appear to be working
			- Url: http://dk5.151.myftpupload.com/pnfw/register/
			- Perhaps it won't work because it is a staging site?
	2) Plugin isn't communicating with Firebase
		a) Since we are sending a notification message, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) should handle showing the notification on the device on behalf of the app
		b) Neither Server Key appears to be working
			- "Legacy Server Key": AIzaSyBA0x9f7aOUKcK7dn16h39uo1F6HYkU9vM
				- also referred to as Web API Key
			- "Server Key": AAAA1x34GAk:APA91bGfJAirRlRPTQpjimUCNeOyeU4tKqb3wTgszLzkwBTQelspiZ_2KksOPN4p1apim5qLqfRUfWByEQJSrfPE10oZGAVQGU1oCkTjNXJ8iIqZL1OB4nXCGP3u013WeMWPgvzbYtKE
	3) Notifications wont be sent if the app is running in the background
		- I tested sending notifications with the emulator & the phone running the app in the foreground

C) Changed Status bar color to same as Toolbar
	- although inspecting the website returned #303030, in the emulator they are the same color when the status bar is #202020

========== 03/01/18 ==========
==============================

I) === Summary: ===
	A) Started syncing Wordpress plugin with Firebase
	B) Renamed App
	C) Set app icon
	D) Set colors
	E) Registered App with API

II) === Takeaways: ===
	- Push Notifications are a lot harder than expected
		A) Just syncing the API key hasn't worked with test posts
			- https://www.delitestudio.com/wordpress/push-notifications-for-wordpress/configuring-android-push-notifications/
		B) trying to POST to the API to subscribe has been a pain
			- https://www.delitestudio.com/wordpress/push-notifications-for-wordpress/documentation/#appsubscribers
			- "Warning:(23, 14) The `<service> FirebaseDeviceRegistration` is not registered in the manifest"
	- Still looks possible to setup category subscriptions for notifications
		- On WordPress -> Push Notifications -> General -> "Categories Filterable by App Subscribers"
			a) Categories (category)
			b) Tags (post_tag)
			c) Format (post_format)
			d) Photo Gallery (bwg_tag)

III) === Resources: ===

	- My Old DevLog: https://github.com/brenthompson2/Rambler_Android/blob/bt_layout_prototype_sidenav/DevLog

IV) === Log: ===

A) Started syncing Wordpress plugin with Firebase
	1) Get Web API Key from Firebase
		- Project Overview -> Settings for the app -> General
		- AlzaSyAnGpizXSy1arufbBFUCpzjJKg7b3CFwsU
	2) Setup Android Notifications
		A) Push Notifications -> General
			- check "Send Push Notifications"
			- check "Send Push Notifications for Posts"
			** This is where it looks like subscribers can be filtered
		B) Push Notifications -> Android
		- Check "send push notifications to Android devices"
		- Add Server Key from A.1
	3) Doesn't appear to have worked

B) Renamed App
	- AndroidManifest.xml
	- android:label="@string/app_name"
	- res > values > styles.xml
	- <string name="app_name">Rambler</string>
	- had to clean up modules.xml

C) Set app icon
	- copied over all of the folders from the OG project
	- res > drawable > mipmap-*

D) Set colors
    <color name="colorPrimary">#9D2336</color>
    <color name="colorPrimaryDark">#8D1E2F</color>
    <color name="colorPrimaryLight">#CE2C45</color>
    <color name="colorSecondary">#DFD1A8</color>
    <color name="colorTertiary">#C4BFB5</color>
    <color name="colorOffBlack">#303030</color>
    <color name="colorAccent">#DFD1A8</color>

E) Registered App with API using Http Post
	1) Created Post Request sender
		- Post Request: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42767249/android-post-request-with-json
		- Making JSON object: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34681158/write-json-to-a-file
		- import URL, HttpURLConnection, DataOutputStream, JSONObject, JSONException
	B) Added FirebaseDeviceRegistration.java to manifest
		- https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/start/
		- "Warning:(23, 14) The `<service> FirebaseDeviceRegistration` is not registered in the manifest"

			- adds dependencies to build.gradle & app/build.gradle

C) Register devices with the Firebase console
	- Right click on "java" in project inspector -> New -> java class
	- FirebaseDeviceRegistration.java
	- Inherit from FirebaseInstanceIdService
	- copied content from old project
	- had to import FirebaseInstanceId & Log

D) Created Message Handler
	- Right click on "app" in project inspector -> new -> service -> service
	- FirebaseMessageHandler
	- Copied content from old project
	- had to import RemoteMessage & Log

E) Displayed Push Notification
	- https://medium.com/@nileshsingh/how-to-add-push-notification-capability-to-your-android-app-a3cac745e56e
	`
	void showNotifications(String title, String msg){
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);
        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, REQUEST_CODE, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);

        Notification notification = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this)
                .setContentText(msg)
                .setContentTitle(title)
                .setContentIntent(pendingIntent)
                .setSmallIcon(R.mipmap.ic_launcher_round)
                .build();

        NotificationManager manager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
        manager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification);
    }
	`
	- NOTIFICATION_ID & REQUEST_CODE are both private members of the class
	`
	private static final int REQUEST_CODE = 1;
    private static final int NOTIFICATION_ID = 6578;
